# grid_search_with_decision_tree
To understand the code you must learn (Decision tree algorithm, ROC, AUC, Grid_searcher, predict_proba)

We will use the dataset from a Kaggle machine learning competition Click-Through Rate Prediction (https://www.kaggle.com/c/a vazu-ctr-prediction).

The data fields are described as follows:
1-id: ad identifier, such as 1000009418151094273, 10000169349117863715 2-click: 0 for non-click, 1 for click
3-hour: in the format of YYMMDDHH, for example, 14102100
4-C1: anonymized categorical variable, such as 1005, 1002
5-banner_pos: where a banner is located, 1 and 0
6-site_id: site identifier, such as 1fbe01fe, fe8cc448, d6137915 
7-site_domain: hashed site domain, such as 'bb1ef334', 'f3845767 
8-site_category: hashed site category, such as 28905ebd, 28905ebd 
9-app_id: mobile app identifier
10-app_domain
11-app_category
12-device_id: mobile device identifier
13-device_ip: IP address
14-device_model: such as iPhone 6, Samsung, hashed by the way 
15-device_type: such as tablet, smartphone, hashed device_conn_type: 
16-Wi-Fi or 3G for example, again hashed in the data 
17-C14-C21: anonymized categorical variables

Don't be scared by the anonymized and hashed values. They are 
categorical features and each possible value of them corresponds to a 
real and meaningful value, but it is presented this way due to the 
privacy policy. Maybe C1 means user gender, and 1005 and 1002 represent 
male and female respectively.
